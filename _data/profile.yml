  Hi everyone! I am Junhao Lu, a student at the School of Economics and Statistics, Guangzhou University, majoring in Statistics. I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sms.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1701/7161.htm" target="_blank">Jianming Hu</a>, under whose guidance I have been conducting interdisciplinary research at the intersection of renewable energy and artificial intelligence. My research interests include <strong>Smart grids</strong>, <strong>Spatio-temporal learning</strong>, and <strong>Probabilistic modeling</strong>, with a particular focus on integrating easoning-capable large language models (LLMs) into energy forecasting and decision-making.
