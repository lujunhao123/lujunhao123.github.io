    Hi everyone! I am Junhao Lu, 
    a student at the School of Economics and Statistics, Guangzhou University, majoring in Statistics. 
    I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. <a href="https://sms.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1571/5701.htm" target="_blank">Jianming Hu</a>. and have been conducting interdisciplinary research on renewable energy and AI under his guidance. 
    My research interests lie in novel energy systems, spatiotemporal forecasting, and deep learning, with a particular focus on integrating large language models (LLMs) into energy forecasting and decision-making.
  </p>
